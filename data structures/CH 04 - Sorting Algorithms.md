# Sorting Algorithms

Almost every action you take in a web app relies on sorted data. Just looking up a user's profile in a database likely relies on a sorted index (which we'll talk about in another course).

Fortunately, most programming languages provide their own standard sorting implementation. In Python, for example, we can use the `sorted` function:

```py
items = [1, 5, 3]
print(sorted(items)) # [1, 3, 5]
```

Notes on the `sorted` function with example

The `key` parameter in the `sorted` function doesn't want the result of the function; it wants the function itself. Think of it like giving a set of instructions to the sorting algorithm. You don't perform the instructions yourself; you just hand the manual to the algorithm so it can use it on every item in the list.

Example:

```py
class Influencer:
    def __init__(self, num_selfies, num_bio_links):
        self.num_selfies = num_selfies
        self.num_bio_links = num_bio_links

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"({self.num_selfies}, {self.num_bio_links})"

def vanity(influencer):
    return influencer.num_selfies + (influencer.num_bio_links * 5)

def vanity_sort(influencers):
    return sorted(influencers, key=vanity)
```
