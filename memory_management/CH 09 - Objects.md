# SnekObjects

Objects in C?!? No. Way.

However, our Sneklang is build in C, and everything in Sneklang is an "object". To be clear, not a _class_ or _object-oriented programming_ object, but a higher-level data structure that _holds some metadate about itself_.
For example:
  * What type of data it holds (int, float, string, etc.)
  * The size of the data it holds
  * The data itself
  * How many references to itself exist (at least later when we build the garbage collector)

That last item it critical. Sneklang is a garbage-collected language, we need to know how many references to an object exist so we can free it when it's no longer needed.
